I went into this project as Analytics Consultant and a couple of months in, I took on the project manager role as well after one of our teammates had to quit the project. As project manager, I felt that our AD micromanaged my duties and didn't allow me to take full ownership of the role. She was also very unstable and would get ""very nervous"" at the slightest issue, which made it hard for the team to stay focused. I feel I spent too much time putting her at ease and reassuring her that things would be ok. I also felt she put a lot of pressure on the team to work at a faster pace than was necessary - from the beginning she spent a lot of time trying to have us finish ahead of schedule. At the end of the project, she told the team last minute that she would not be at the final meeting with the client because she had to travel. That meeting was later rescheduled due to weather and she told me she was traveling through the end of the month so she would not be able to attend any rescheduled meeting. So it became apparent that perhaps her motive for rushing the project was to accommodate her travel plans. Among other issues that came up throughout the project, I spent too much time managing her and answering questions that she could easily locate if she referred to emails or project materials - so while I felt the project timeline was very appropriate to accommodate people with varied schedules, she made me feel at times overwhelmed and rushed to complete tasks.",Kiran Chhapra,Sonia Diaz,Already have,Definitely would,,"The experience, with the exception of our AD, was great and very rewarding.

I'm wondering if there's some way for Taproot to vet the clients better before assigning grants by making sure they aren't contemplating a major change within their organization and thereby interrupting the working process or timeline.

He had volunteered for the organization in the past, was very personally invested in their mission and goals (and his interpretation of them), and through the course of this project, decided to join one of the organization's major planning committees. It made it very difficult to objectively do anything regarding the work of the organization, as it was all filtered through his view of its capabilities and his sense of what the priorities should be. He also had his own view of what the project should do - focusing very much on ""strategic questions"" for the organization, but (and again, perhaps because of his personal investment in the organization?), I felt like he was putting the cart before the horse, with an already-established answer for what the solutions should be, while the rest of the team was trying to better account for what the questions and problems were. I didnt notice this on my prior project, that seemed to map out on the blueprint more, and didnt have such a strong focus on self-identified strategic questions. Perhaps this could be avoided through better project management, but from an institutional standpoint, it may be beneficial if Taproot tried to avoid such direct personal involvement by its project managers in the nonprofits for which they're overseeing projects."2952371357,47858816,12/02/2013,12/02/2013,108.240.250.137,azhar.harris63@yahoo.com,Azhar,Harris,Human Resources (HR) Capacity Build service grant completed in Nov 2013,Azhar,Harris,azhar.harris63@yahoo.com,Chicago,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,North Lawndale Employment Network,Human Resources Capacity Build,,HR Generalist,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,Having the non profit gain a positive perspective on Human Resources and hiring appropriate staff.,Have a limited amount of resources to work with.,Carolyn Walsh,Rebecca Watkins,,Definitely would,,2952365773,47858816,12/02/2013,12/02/2013,75.80.62.71,lakshmi_paranthaman@hotmail.com,Lakshmi,Paranthaman,Strategic Planning Prep service grant completed in Nov 2013,Lakshmi,Paranthaman,lakshmi_paranthaman@hotmail.com,Los Angeles,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,SCANPH,Strategic Planning Prep,,Strategy Associate,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,5,5,2,4,3,3,I enjoyed working with one of my teammates who was very competent and learned from him.,"Too many of the in-person interviews and presentations fell on my shoulders as one person dropped out, one moved to the bay area and was out of town during the week, and one person started a new job and didn't have the flexibility to leave early.

It was also frustrating that there was scope creep which seemed to be brought on by someone from the client's side, who was not involved with the Taproot project from the onset or the application grant, it seems.

I think that there also needs to be more reinforcement by Taproot of the 'ground rules' at the new volunteer orientation session + at the start of each engagement.  Generally speaking, most people are good natured, amicable, and united in their interest to serve the community.  However, as it is Chicago, we have individuals who have relocated from different parts of the globe with different expectations on communication, feedback / analysis, and professional conduct.  While I have international experience, I don't think anyone could have predicted or expected such behavior as I was dealt by one Taproot member.  In addition to ignoring emails, which had action items and direct questions for her, she also missed meetings and/or arrived 20 minutes late.  She then thought it was appropriate to yell at / attempt to humiliate me before the team, indicating that I hadn't provided certain key information -- when in fact, they were and multiple times, at that.  She was not collaborative or open to any sort of editing or feedback on her interview report write-ups, which were fraught with sentence fragments, spelling errors, and unclear references - basic questions resulted in outbursts and personal attacks.

I have a lot of respect for the impact they have made and their efforts to improve food policy. I believe that the policies they work to effect, support and change are vital to our nation for moral and ethical reasons as well as for the fact that without a nourished populace, our society will fall behind. I was proud to contribute to their cause and have already told the CFPA staff that I would like to contribute further in the future (after  a brief community service hiatus due to the upcoming birth of my child).","We unfortunately had some serious problems with our team, causing a lot of stress and additional time spent dealing with behavior problems. Lee Ann, our AD, was great. We have worked together before and chose to work together again on this project. I also enjoyed interacting with Sabrina, our brand strategist, though we did have a few language issues crop up. That aside, I think she is smart, capable and pleasant to work with and may have also been impacted by the negative and difficult personalities on our team. Our copywriter and marketing manager were a different story. I regret having to say this but I recommend that Taproot reconsider having the marketing manager, Gayle Gilfillan, as a pro-bono consultant. I do not think she represents the organization well and I think her extremely negative attitude during the project toward her team, Taproot processes and the client make her a liability, as well as an unpleasant and difficult teammate. She consistently challenged me and the AD, to the point of screaming at us on the phone (more than once). She balked at committing to regular meetings. She balked at committing to her portion of the work (after agreeing to sign on and saying she understood the role). The AD wound up taking on one of her major deliverables. She constantly criticized the client in ways that were beyond constructive and instead came across as disrespectful. She complained often about Taproot processes. Toward the end, she said she no longer cared about the project (in less polite language). I became pregnant shortly after signing on and after going through my first trimester with bad morning sickness, extreme fatigue and constant battles with Gayle, considered leaving the project to protect my health. It was the last thing I wanted to do and I worked it out with my AD but I hate that I got to that point. I strongly believed in our mission and resented that Gayle made the process so difficult when it didn't need to be that way. She was so negative that the AD and I were afraid of letting her speak to the client alone and of what she might say during board training. Obviously we need to give the client constructive criticism--and we did--but her comments in team meetings about the client were over the line and disrespectful. Our copywriter was not as difficult as Gayle but she was also a problematic team member. Bri is smart and capable but she sometimes came across as immature in her approach to the project. She initially said she wanted to take a bigger role in the project and when it no longer suited her, she simply didn't fulfill her duties--leaving our brand manager in the lurch. She responded poorly to feedback, dismissing comments from the AD and I or responding in a churlish manner. We were always sensitive in giving feedback and were careful to do so in a way that was constructive and not overbearing. I have been a marketing writer and have managed creative teams so I understand the importance of respecting the writer's vision and not dictating. However, Bri didn't seem to want to hear any comments from either of us (or, at times, from the client) no matter how they were delivered. She delivered good work in the end but both the AD and I felt that she was often rude and dismissive and didn't feel it necessary to adhere to deadlines, meet team commitments or respond to emails in a timely manner. This was unfortunate as she made a great first impression and we were both excited to have her on the team. It could be that she just has some growing to do in terms of professional maturity. I realize this is a harsh assessment of some of our team members and I regret having to write it. But both Lee Ann and I felt that complete honesty was merited in this situation for the good of the Taproot organization. It's a bit uncomfortable having to deliver these types of comments in a survey as I would rather do so in a conversation. If you would like to speak more about this project, I would be happy to set up a call. On a positive note, I had a better experience with the non-profit. We had some trouble initially getting through to them regarding the fact that in discovery interviews, we heard consistently that they were challenging to work with. We wanted to deliver this message gently but felt it was important for them to know since their success is dependent on collaboration. We also had a taste of their thorniness at times. I think they all mean well though and by the end of the project, I felt they were making an effort to be more open and collaborative and a bit ""softer.""  I also had a great experience working with my client contact, Alexis. She is smart and dedicated and was a pleasure to work with throughout.",Lee Ann Bezazian,"Gayle Gilfillan, Bri James",Already have,Definitely would,,"I recommend reviewing the templates for the project as they don't all match up with the new quick start guide. This made it a bit confusing for the team. In terms of hiring pro-bono consultants, I recommend that you spend more time assessing the candidates' willingness to commit a significant amount of time and energy to projects as well as to assessing their ability to work well with others. It's great to be smart and have experience but if you don't want to put the time in or you are uncomfortable working under a peer in a volunteer situation, Taproot probably isn't a great fit. You may wind up hiring fewer consultants but they will be of higher quality. This will help the organization in providing a better overall experience for grantees as well as by ensuring that you don't lose good consultants because they've had bad experiences."2831778147,45309925,09/26/2013,09/26/2013,24.5.21.18,sandy@strawbridgesenn.com,Sandra,Strawbridge,Key Messages & Brand Strategy service grant completed in Sep 2013,Sandy,Strawbridge,sandy@strawbridgesenn.com,SF Bay Area,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,World Savvy,Key Messages & Brand Strategy,,Account Director,2,3,3,3,4,2,2,2,1,2,3,3,4,2,4,learning more about the non-profit world,out of town client and some poor skills within our team,"Ed Kamrin, Betty Chen",Cindy Cooper,Already have,,,2830144718,45309925,09/26/2013,09/26/2013,76.21.49.94,jeffportwood@gmail.com,Jeff,Portwood,Human Resources (HR) Capacity Build service grant completed in Sep 2013,Jeff,Portwood,jeffportwood@gmail.com,SF Bay Area,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,"ASIAN, Inc.",Human Resources Capacity Build,,Account Director,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,3,"Observing a member of the client team move from little to no engagement, to an excited and confident contributor",Schedule demands were the most difficult; changing personal and professional situations over six months are bound to happen - most challenging but our team worked together well to overcome and move forward throughout,"I would be excited and proud to work with every member of this team: Erica Stanulis, Marc Pinto and Jane Naito",,Already have,Definitely would,,"I am buried in a new job and not able to take on another project at this time, but I'm excited about the experience and expect to participate again."2827077376,45309925,09/24/2013,09/24/2013,198.179.137.2,ckammerer@waterstonegroup.com,Christopher,Kammerer,Strategic Planning Prep service grant completed in Sep 2013,Christopher,Kammerer,ckammerer@waterstonegroup.com,Chicago,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,High Jump,Strategic Planning Prep,,Strategy Consultant,4,3,4,2,1,4,2,2,3,2,4,2,3,3,5,"For me, the most rewarding part was helping a non-profit with such a great mission: helping smart, under-resourced kids get into good high schools",Team members who didn't have a strategy consulting background struggled to make meaningful contributions; the Project Manager struggled with project planning and meeting goals/agenda; 2 team members left 2/3 of the way through,,Barbara Immergluck,Already have,,,"The deliverables for the Strategic Planning Prep are weak.

As a result, the timeline in the Taproot system, unfortunately, contained unrealistic, unrealizable dates for the milestones, even when it was occasionally updated.  2. The client had virtually no involvement. They sat back and waited for us to perform.  3. There were times in which the client was slow to respond to requests or provide feedback, which then delayed the project; and then they commented that they had expected to receive the deliverable sooner. Cumulatively, I estimate that client delays accounts for about 5-7 weeks of delay over the life of the project.  4.

Our project manager left the project early and was never replaced, so our account director took on her role--a mistake.  Then our graphic designer had attitude issues and was finally removed, but not replaced, and our account director took on that role as well. Although I commend him for taking on so much, we should have replaced those roles early on with new people, as the frustrations of the project started to weigh on him, heavily.  Having stated that, there was a great deal of teeth pulling trying to get information from the client, yet I expected them to have difficulty in this area, as this was the reason we were enlisted to help. It's nothing that I haven't dealt with before, nor anything I wasn't expecting (as frustrating as it was dealing with our client) but our account director seemed to disagree, and found the client to be quite disorganized and absentminded, to the point of wanting to end the project. I'd like to think that better management decisions throughout would have led to a better working relationship between client and team, and an overall smoother better end result.",Jeremy Loudenback,"Chris Hamilton, Lee Tomka (but would consider in the future)",,Definitely would,"I'm biased, because despite the frustrations, I grew immensely from this project and would love to do work like this full-time!",No other comments.

There have been a variety of aspects of that experience from the very positive to the negative, so it is not easy to come up with a consistent theme in the provision of input to you.  I greatly appreciated your own understanding of my upset and concerns when you entered a difficult situation after Kandaces abrupt departure.  I could have been more understanding of your own situation at that point.  The way you reacted made me feel better about Taproot and especially your own role and our ability to communicate with each other.    I will provide some commentary related to my experiences and areas that Taproot might consider as it moves forward.        COMMENTARY    Initial Reactions    My initial reactions and involvement with Taproot were quite positive.  I was impressed with Kandace and the two initial meetings, including training related to the Taproot process.  I was impressed with the structured information about the various programs, as long as they were suggestions rather than requirements.  Additionally, I was fortunate to be assigned to the TLC project, the first one in which I had expressed interest.    Recruitment for the Project    One of my most difficult experiences was recruiting for the TLC Project.  Although there were a large number of candidates listed, few were actually available, interested, or qualified.  Half the people that I contacted did not have the courtesy to respond that they were neither available nor interested.  Of the remainder, some who responded were not available at the time.  The first person that I talked to as a potential project manager indicated a need to be appointed to the position prior to even meeting with me in person.  Regretfully, I agreed.  After meeting her and introducing her to TLC leadership, we mutually decided it would be better for her not to continue.      Fortunately, I subsequently found two strong candidates in Erica Caplan and Sara Yang.  Although I believed that the three of us (or even two of us) could effectively complete the project, I wanted to be a compliant Account Director and have the five team members that Taproot suggests for a project of this type.  I continued to work at identifying additional team members.  I found two others who were interested in working on the project but expressed some concerns about their time limitations.  I acknowledged such restrictions and identified a modest role for them to play.  For one, I sent some materials for her to review and provide feedback.  She never even followed up with any feedback.   For another, I asked for a time for us to talk about specifics and did not hear from her for three weeks.  At that time she indicated that she had taken a job and did not have much time for any project work.  I removed both of these people from the project team.    In summary, a huge amount of time was wasted in recruitment efforts, and many of these individuals were neither available nor interested in serving as pro bono consultants.    Conduct of the Project    The best part of my experience was the actual conduct of the project.  The two team members were exceptional.  Although quite busy, they worked hard and efficiently to produce a strong product and outcome.  Additionally, the two TLC leaders (Executive Director and Human Resources Lead) were also exceptional in the involvement and support they offered to the project.  I feel that the five of us worked very well together in a manner that compared to some of the best consulting projects with which I have been involved.    Monitoring of the Project by Taproot    There were some problems for me with Taproots monitoring of the project.  Automatically generated requests for input on a weekly basis waste time and are disrespectful to the Account Directors.  I did discuss these concerns with Kandace and yourself, and both of you made some accommodations.    It would seem that shortly after a project begins that you might want to check with the organization to see how it perceives the work of the pro bono consultants.  Such input could then determine the extent of your need for oversight and review of the consultants.  Additionally, arrangements can be made with each Account Director regarding the timing, frequency and nature of follow-up.  I had not been so micro-managed this closely since I had been in graduate school and just beginning consulting work.  I did my best to shield the project manager from having to deal with the requests.  I typically shared with her my responses to these requests, and she was amazed at the level of inquiry.        The Closing Call    The closing conference call was a little strange.  Mini conducted the call in a reasonable manner to collect information that was hopefully useful for her.  However, as a conference call in which Kate and Max were apparently to participate, other than stating that they were present at the beginning of the call, there was not another word that came from either of them (not even a good-bye at the end).  I even made a positive comment about Max and his background during the conversation with Mini, partly to see if he was still there (or awake), but there was no response.  This is hardly a big deal, but I doubt that I am the only one who would perceive this type of conference call behavior as a bit strange and inappropriate.       AREAS FOR CONSIDERATION    Personnel Management    The true mettle of an organization is represented by the manner in which it deals with its employees.  I was particularly distressed about Kandaces departure, and especially about the manner in which it occurred.  I had been impressed with Kandace in my involvement and interactions with her.  When we had differences of opinion, we were able to discuss and satisfactorily resolve them.  Certainly, there may have been areas in which she performed poorly or even that she did not belong in her position.  The manner of her dismissal, however, seems inappropriate unless she was stealing from the organization or abusing its employees.  Additionally, it had been noted to me that this type of dismissal process is not atypical for Taproot.  Subsequently, I understand that Beth was also dismissed.  It is difficult to understand how an organization in the business of providing pro bono consulting support to others has a culture of managing its own personnel in such a negative manner.    Nature of Consultants    I have concerns about the consultants that are presented as being available for the pro bono projects.  It is not clear whether they are truly available or whether their background has been adequately assessed.  Hardly any of the potential consultants that I reviewed had previously been involved in any Taproot project, and the general lack of responsiveness of a good number seemed to demonstrate little commitment to Taproots work.  Additionally, it seemed that a significant number of those on the list were in job transition and were not necessarily committed to pro bono consulting work.  In my previous pro bono consulting activities, other consultants with whom I was involved had a different profile than most of those that I encountered in my recruitment efforts for the Taproot project.  They were highly experienced professionals from corporate and consulting settings who had a strong commitment to do work with the non-profit sector.  Although some of the Taproot consultants might fit that profile, it might be possible to recruit a higher proportion of individuals with such background and commitment.     Efficiency    Highly qualified individuals desiring to serve as pro bono consultants need to be extremely efficient in the utilization of their time.  For Taproot to recruit and utilize such highly qualified consultants, it will need to be more efficient in dealing with them, respect their capabilities, and allow them to use the time that they contribute in the most effective manner.  Clearly, the management and oversight of Taproot personnel would need to be modified.      It is hard to understand why it is necessary for five individuals to typically comprise a Taproot pro bono consulting team.  Especially with the time constraints, it can be difficult to manage a team of that size, and the work that needs to be done does not seem to necessitate such a number of personnel.  Even our team of three was more than ample for the TLC project, and it could have easily been done with any two of us.  I needlessly spent a significant amount of time in the recruitment process.      I am not sure of the benefit of listing a large number of consultants who are not interested or committed to truly to engaging in pro bono work or to overstaffing projects with more individuals than is necessary to efficiently complete the work.  There may be alternatives that would allow you to recruit more qualified and committed consultants and provide a higher level of pro bono support to the non-profits in the communities that you serve.      CONCLUSION    It is important to qualify my comments and observations as coming from an individual who has a limited vantage point.  I feel comfortable in sharing this input with you as you are open-minded and can also share alternative perspectives given your broader knowledge about the Washington Office and Taproot.    I hope that some of this input is of value to you.  If you would like to follow-up, I would be glad to do so either by telephone or in person.    I view my Taproot and TLC experience as being very valuable.  I remain available to continue to support TLC and will expand my involvement in pro bono work.  Such work has been very enjoyable and provides an opportunity to make contributions in areas that are very important to me.  It has brought me back to my early days in Community Psychology.    Again, thank you for your support and involvement, and I look forward to keeping in touch."2376400035,36802932,12/06/2012,12/06/2012,98.227.98.173,ranveig.belt@gmail.com,,,,Ranni,Belt,ranvieg.belt@gmail.com,,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,Oak Park Regional Housing Center,Key Messages & Brand Strategy,,Project Manager,2,5,5,5,2,2,2,3,1,5,2,5,5,5,3,"The result was very good, just very late and that was very frustrating to manage",The delays on delivering the creatives,,,,Definitely would,,I am impressed by the way Taproot is run and I am looking forward to doing more projects2376167108,36802932,12/05/2012,12/05/2012,71.187.74.248,mariedmcgurk@gmail.com,,,,Marie,McGurk,mariedmcgurk@gmail.com,,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Wellness in the Schools,Annual Report,,Copyeditor/Writer,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,2,Being able to create an annual report that would truly benefit WITS.,Not everyone on the team was able to complete their work.,Carol Polisner,Jenny Fu,Already have,,,2375463989,36802932,12/05/2012,12/05/2012,66.215.92.206,suelachance@yahoo.com,,,,Sue,LaChance,suelachance@yahoo.com,,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Inner-city Arts,Key Messages & Brand Strategy,,Brand Strategist,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,2,2,5,2,2,3,Learning more about the organization and the good work it does for the children of los angeles.,The project went on for a long time and exceeded the initial scope... however the client was pleased in the end.,"The team was great - Oliver, Shelley and Jen",,,Definitely would,,The Taproot Website could use some updating.

She made it a sometimes not-so-fun project to be on. Templates are very complete but results in a lot of repetition (i.e., the powerpoints). Eventually we stopped using them. As project manager and not having picked the team myself (hence not confident in the consultant's skillset initially) and then learning that the client had printed all docs and was following them.... I erred on the side of caution and followed everything completely at the onset. Taproot should either revisit the docs or state boldly and clearly that they are just for reference. I suggest revisiting or stating which ones are mandatory since as a 'professional' org, you may want to  have some consistency across the engagements. Taproot and whomever chooses the team needs to properly screen the team members to ensure they have time and flexibility to meet - it was hard for our group to meet in person but when we did, we did really good work. Suggest some kind of a central spot on the taproot site to share interview notes, docs, etc. We had lots of emails and no one place to store everything so that we could read everything and get a similar 'complete' picture of the client (during the analysis phase).

There was one member of the team who was absent from the calls most of the time and then, when he did choose to call in, made demands that were inappropriate at that particular stage of the project. He seemed to feel that the client just didn' t know what they wanted and that we should do whatever we (read he) wanted and basically tell them that we were right and they were wrong. He would go over things thhat we had been working on for weeks without his input and expect vast changes even after the client had approved everything. In the end he just disappeared.

I learned a lot about marketing for a non-profit organization with new website tools and resources and enjoyed collaborating with a great group of professionals interested in community service.  The Community House was a challenging website project that required developing a new user friendly website with quite a bit of streamlining of existing content while elevating awareness of all program offerings. The Taproot volunteers on the project Monika Chodkiewicz  Graphic Designer, Patrick DiMichele - Project Manager and Information Architect, Becky Heneghan-Gonzalez  Marketing Manager, Bennett Neuhauser  content writer, and Kurt Olsen  Website Developer were outstanding.  They brought an exceptional skillset and provided loads of experience, ideas, feedback and alternatives throughout the entire process and did so with enthusiasm and a strong commitment the quality, completion and sustainability of the website.   The Community House staff was truly collaborative with everyone on the project committed to the success of the website.  We had non-technical personnel especially, Dan Janowick, step up to lead and meet project needs, but also had board members, Christine Schwartz and Amy Gaber, and department leads , Kari Moore and Sara Sieracki, provide great direction on the goals and scope, architecture, design  and content needs for the website.  Jeni Fabian's timing as the new Executive Director helped us move forward confidently with each milestone and feeling gratified that they could sustain the website on their own.   The Community House helped to maintain a strong momentum with their continuous expression of appreciation to the Taproot volunteers for their time and effort.  The Taproot Foundation is great organization I recommend other marketers to join.  They provide invaluable time and talent for non-profit organizations with limited marketing resources to further their causes.   I was impressed from the beginning with the amount of resources available and step-by-step, documented processes to make each milestone in the project as well as the final outcome a success.  This was especially helpful for me as a first time volunteer directing a team of volunteers.   As an Account Director, you need to be prepared to jump in and fill any gaps in the process of completing a Taproot project.  I was appreciative of the guidance from the program directors, Joshua Brown, who was an amazing sounding board, and Miriam Young, who helped me close out the project.   I was also able to reach out to other Account Directors and post questions to other volunteers and recommend that everyone take more advantage of all opportunities to network with other Taproot members."2130902812,32925568,05/21/2012,05/21/2012,67.169.105.124 ,rrogerlewis@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,Community Youth Center of San Francisco,Human Resources Capacity Build,,Account Director,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,To manage the project despite several obstacles and adverse circumstances.,"To locate suited volunteers with a professional consultant demeanor.

It was initially frustrating that Taproot and the account manager hadn't identified these problems at the grant approval stage...

It was very interesting to get an insider's view of the company, especially to learn how nonprofit people think and how the nonprofit culture is different from what I typically experience in the corporate world. I felt strongly emphatic with the company's objectives. They were very friendly and gave us a lot of goodwill and trust.","In my opinion, the more senior (age-wise) members of the team struggled with the technologies and time management through the whole project. Our meetings, both internal and facing the client, were very long and lacked the efficiency that modern communication tools provide (such as presentations, use of computers in general). Team meetings were excruciatingly long, with most time spent going back on forth on the single question of what the goal of the project was. And in this regard comes the main reason for my frustration: I strongly believed that our final deliverable was not corresponding to the purpose of the project.  Specifically, instead of educating the client about the process of strategic planning, senior members of the team got too involved into providing the client with very specific recommendations that were not based on any expertise or knowledge in the field. Some of the recommendations and suggestions were offensive to the feelings of the client, in my strong opinion. Also, I was really shocked about the misuse of confidential information from third parties: as a phase of the project, we interviewed various third parties such as members of other dance companies, theater staff and even governmental officials. During the interviews, we never mentioned that the response can be shared verbatim with our client, and in some instances we actually promised confidentiality to the interviewees; however, to make the final report more ""credible"" and create a ""wow"" factor, the managers in the team insisted on giving the client the transcripts of all interviews, disclosing the names of interviewees and their responses close to verbatim. Within the team, we argued about it to no avail. I am bewildered by this experience, because in the corporate world it would have likely created legal problems, and as far as the client goes, I imagine that they are likely to feel hurt reading what people said about them thinking that BDC would not know. It serves no purpose and would likely make BDC regret their decision to pursue the Taproot grant.

And we added an entire Spanish-language section to the MayView site--something they had never had despite many of their clients only speaking Spanish.,"The client said they wanted a new site, and for the most part they were responsive to what needed to happen to get a new one up and running, but their overall attitude seemed passive and not all that excited.   That concern has been borne out by the fact that there were a few things they needed to do to really finish the site that they have not yet done two months later. For example, our web guru, Chris, told them how to fix an alignment issue that's causing the headline to butt up against the top banner on some pages (e.g. Locations-->Palo Alto and News and Events-->Calendar, just to name two). I know enough HTML to realize that it would take about 5-10 minutes to fix all the pages, yet they still haven't done it. Nor have they finished filling in the Spanish-language pages.  The real kicker was when they admitted to our account director, Linda, right at the end of the project that, ""we never intended to rewrite any of our material."" In other words, they just wanted a prettier website; they didn't care whether the copy was effective or not.  They also said, ""Patty's content guidelines were for new content; we aren't writing anything from the beginning for this project."" Of course my guidelines weren't just for new copy; they were also for making existing copy clearer and more succinct.  I should note that they did end up using my intro copy for the new section home pages. Also, JoAnn Cabrera's existing copy was good, although I think she was under pressure from Shamima to put in a lot of extra text. At one point, they wanted to put most of their annual report on one page; we convinced them to summarize it and provide a link to a PDF. So the text didn't end up badly at all. But for them to pretend all along that they would accept the help of a writer/editor when in fact they had no intention of doing so was extremely deceptive.  I'm proud of the work I did on site organization/navigation and writing new copy for the home page and section home pages. But I was working on the assumption that they really wanted my help, and obviously they didn't.   BTW, they never gave us an end-of-project party, either. It was just a normal meeting. They did have sandwiches; they had also provided food at our other 6:00 p.m. meetings. So that was nice. But there was nothing special about our last get-together. I could never tell whether Shamima wasn't really enthusiastic about the project or is just a very undemonstrative person. Anyway, what with the revelation of their not having wanted writing help plus not having anything that felt like a party, the end of the project was dissatisfying. ",,,Already have,,"The last time I suggested that someone work with Taproot, she was turned down even though she is a highly experienced project manager. Apparently Taproot now has more volunteers than projects (not the case when I started), and you don't need any more PMs or ADs. I don't recall the details, but I did get the impression that she was brushed off somewhat curtly. So I'm now less apt to suggest volunteering with Taproot to my friends.","My first Taproot project was for a website (Breast Cancer Connections), and it went extremely well. Our ideas were welcomed warmly and implemented in full. We were even invited to some special BCC events as though we were major donors.   My second website, Support Network for Women, was a disaster, with SNBW's ED not standing up to a longtime volunteer who thought she ran the place and wanted to do all the design and writing herself (which is why their existing site was so bad), and with our AD not supporting his team when SNBW trashed our input.   Although the MayView project wasn't nearly that bad, it was obviously crushing to me to find out that all they really wanted was a new design; they never understood that the text of a website is just as important as the design for drawing people in, evoking the desired emotional response (such as relief that they've found a place that can help them), and giving them the information they need clearly and succinctly.   I think, therefore, that something needs to be changed in the screening process to make sure that the nonprofit understands how important it is for text and graphics to work together, and is truly committed to making the writing work well for their website visitors. As it stands now, it appears that nonprofits are saying, ""Oh yes, we want a new website!"" when all they really want is a pretty design and maybe more logical navigation. Somehow, Taproot needs to educate nonprofits on the importance of website text, and, as I said, make sure that they're on board with an ENTIRE website redesign before they're given a service grant."2130902497,32925540,02/04/2012,02/04/2012,108.65.1.167   ,cmatowers@sbcglobal.net,,,,Marcy,Straw,cmatowers@sbcglobal.net,,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,Greater Richmond Interfaith Program,Brochure,,Account Director,5,5,5,,2,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,2,2,2,Seeing the final result and knowing the impact it will have on GRIP's fundraising and outreach activities.,Having the Graphic Designer disappear - with the close-to-final design files - necessitating a scramble to find a new designer and rebuild the brochure design.,all the remaining team; obviously the MIA designer has been dropped from Taproot,,Already have,,,2130902494,32925540,02/04/2012,02/04/2012,98.210.39.22   ,egraylow@yahoo.com,,,,Elayne,Graylow,egraylow@gmail.com,,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,LaRaza Centro Legal,Board Recruitment,,Project Manager,2,2,2,4,4,3,4,5,2,3,2,4,4,4,3,Working with the Account Director,"The team interaction, dependability, understanding of scope, communication, lack of interest, my lack of motivation",Linda Jackson,John Hyde,,,Depends on what they want to get out of it,I think that this type of volunteering works if you are not working fulltime.

While most of the volunteers on the team were competent and dedicated, a couple individuals in particular were very weak - both in terms of skill set and engagement.  This brought down morale for the whole team, as well as resulted in a late and low quality deliverable.  While I understand that Taproot relies on volunteers for their projects, it was disappointing to me that Taproot as an organization would be comfortable pawning such poor quality work off on a nonprofit client who depends on our efforts, when it would never be acceptable in the corporate world to do that. 2. The PM was unable to keep the team motivated and ensure quality of deliverables.  The AM, while involved heavily in the beginning, did not step in and appropriate checkpoints to ensure timely delivery or quality of work. ",Greg Michel,Lisa Ghisolf,,,"Not based on the experience that I had, though I know others have had very positive experiences","If Taproot wants to treat their nonprofit clients as clients, then they should treat their volunteer staff as they would project hires. That means reasonable screening for proof of skill set before staffing them on a project. It's great that volunteers can use Taproot experience to reinforce their own skill set, but they shouldn't be using nonprofits in that way just to build their portfolios, while giving them second rate, half-a$$ed work that would never be acceptable to give to a client otherwise.  I joined Taproot because it came highly recommended to me by friends (specifically, the NY branch), and so I'll consider this past experience a one-off.

The support from Taproot was essential and I depended on Skip's guidance and email instructions on each stage of the process. Loved working with him.   In the beginning, I found the Blueprint and all the Taproot material completely overwhelming. Plus a lot of the terminology and acronyms were new to me and took a little while to get the hang of it. That being said, the structure and in-depth descriptions were a godsend and contributed significantly in a successful outcome.  I would have preferred meeting with my Taproot team in person during the final stages of the project. However, that was not possible for a number of reasons. I think it would have expedited the discussions on creative and copy.  The main thing I would do differently next time is interviewing potential candidates much more thoroughly. I did pursue the issue of conflict-of-interest with our first MM before the project started and she said she was fine with proceeding. Perhaps our experience was unavoidable, but I would still spend more time with candidates.

","The International House clients are incredibly intelligent and very professional--when they engage. The challenge was getting them to meet any sort of deadline. They wouldn't just miss; they'd miss by weeks and sometimes months. I realize they are busy, but at times the Taproot team wondered privately if this was truly an urgent project to them. Which is a shame because, like I said, when they did engage, they were some of the brightest and most thoughtful clients I have ever worked with in any capacity.

A copywriter must be involved with the discovery interviews in order to capture the nuance and voice of the organization -- it's not possible to glean that from the interview notes that the marketing manager takes (they're not verbatim, they miss some of the tone, and that's frankly not what they're looking for).

My main observation is that the team structure could be changed to speed the project - which I see as a problem for clients and a unneccesary requirement on the volunteers.  I think that larger teams may make it easier to progress projects faster. I believe this would be well received by the clients. I think the length of the project cuts into momentum and ultimately adds considerably to the overall requirements for volunteers. If there were 2 more 'functional' roles on the team the project would progress 2 months quicker and probably better. I suggest the account director role has functional requirements in addition to client mangement and the project management role be taken on by the junior recruitment advisor. Add to this an extra role that could be functional in marketing or recruitment to share the work and it would make it more robust and ultiamtely progress quicker. All of this is seen through my perspective where we lost a team-member part way through the project but even with that consideration I felt that more practical and functional roles on the team would exponentially increase the speed and robustness of the product.   Formal project management guidelines seemed overly detailed for the pace and complexity of the project - especially when there was a full PM role. I feel that the project management guides are playing to the lowest denominator which if we are staffing with professionals shouldn't be required.  The templates for presentations are EXTREMELY buggy and not easy and good to work with. this really affected my enjoyment of the project. It made what should have been exciting (putting together findings) an uneccesary pain. They look great and the content is good, but the templates themselves are not put together well on the Board recruitment project.  Overall I had a great time and will definitely do it again. I enjoyed my colleagues and the clients were fantastic. PCC is a great group of professionals that will continue on their path to growth through their talent and passion alone. I  strongly encourage Taproot to continue their support of PCC.

HSJ appreciated our honest feedback and attempts at creating structure within the organization.,"I guess, one of the most challenging bits was that the scope of the project widened considerably with the organization wanting to question and re-questiona and re-examine the mission and vision. The assumption was that all that had been agreed upon by all board members and staff before our project began, and that we as the Project team wouldn't be extending our time into helping them structure that. The project went on for way longer than mandated and started demanding a lot of time and attention beyond the timeline decided on. This led to some personal frustration because my work commitments increased as well. The project team deserves respect and all team members attention, and this became tough with work and personal commitments mounting up. I hadn't budgeted for the additional months and it was difficult working around some of those commitments.  Another area of deep concern was the associate director's involvement in the project. While he was involved for the first 2-3 months gradually, the team stopped hearing from him completely after a certain point. The AD would not attend meetings, answer emails, or work on the project AT ALL, leave alone interact with the client. I would have had no problems if the individual were to speak to the team and say 'hey I cant do this right now, and I have to back off' but to completey disappear without a word? It was very unprofessional and created strain on the team since now there were only 4 team members really working and racking their brains.

Taproot (Alison) kindly found us a graphic designer who was more familiar with InDesign, but she was unable to help us when she discovered that Max had used some Mac fonts and she only had a Windows system. So, although I don't know much about InDesign, I volunteered to fix the type myself. Meghan spent a couple of hours on the phone with me sorting out what to do about various aspects of the typography, and some designer friends where I do parttime work also helped me, so it turned out fine.

Perhaps Max misunderstood the duties of the graphic designer on a Taproot project and didn't realize that he would be responsible for the final InDesign file?

The other thing was around defining the criteria for the onsite interviews.

The software configurer came through in the end but was very slow to understand the business need and figure out the software. The Taproot deliverable templates are poorly constructed and hard to use, and really didn't help that much. Taproot either needs to screen for developers who are adept at independent learning, or provide Salesforce training. Even a Salesforce ERD would have been a huge help. I ended up feeling like I was the only team member who understood what needed to be done. It was never clear what the data role on the team was for. The PM was an obstacle. Our developer was a nice man who eventually got it figured out. Our Account Manager Rob Holt was excellent.  When it comes down to it a donor database is no mystery and it's unlikely core requirements will vary much client to client. Taproot should consider combining the PM and BA roles, or the BA/software configurer roles and maybe doing away with the data role. Also, evolutionary prototyping would have been a much more effective approach than the waterfall approach prescribed by Taproot. It's probable that Taproot could even have a core configuration that would meet most of the needs of most clients. All in all, the approach and structure was wasteful and the technical team unprepared.

In an earlier meeting you suggested we not scrub and I am holding to that principle.  So, no scrubbing asked of you either.   In short, can you can complete the template work for the two tables you started?  And beyond the template work, can you help with the testing side of things?  BHNV's testing will be the principal activity.  But testing the data/relationships and reports based on your past experience will be very helpful in delivering a quality product.

Three reasons:  1. Outdated Processes and Scope of Requirements Few websites can afford to be static these days; websites are living, breathing publishing platforms that often scale to include dynamic data, web services, syndication channels, content management systems, and user accounts. I was surprised that Taproot's scope for advanced websites basically treated the deliverables as a handful of static html pages. Really? This isn't 1999. Few nonprofits (or any org, for that matter) will benefit from having a static ""brochure"" site that can't grow. Most will agree: a CMS is a minimum-ante these days.  FACT: websites are software: they are complex, data-rich, and MUST be scalable.  2. Wrong Project Management Methodology The Taproot blueprint used a ""waterfall""style of project management  as opposed to ""agile"" project management, which would have been far more appropriate. ""Waterfall"" management (gant charts, a linear progression of phases and responsibilities, client input only in beginning and end) is far too rigid and ""front-loaded"" with planning to work successfully for larger scopes. Large systems NEVER develop according to plan. Inevitably, large projects reveal new requirements midstream, or impart new knowledge / insights as development is happening. There are too many contingencies, too many midstream changes, too many decisions to be made at every milestone. That's why an ""Agile"" methodology is how today's software teams manage themselves to avoid failure: they work *iteratively* and involve the client in a close, constant feedback loop.  3. Too Much Paperwork and too many documents to track and version. The taproot blueprint, as well as the vast majority of team communications required an endless back-and-forth of files and document versions. It's unmanageable and extremely inefficient to track multiple doc versions / variants in email attachments and manually collate and merge them every week.

After the initial discovery / marketing recommendation phases, our marketing person literally didn't need to be involved anymore. Why not dismiss her from the project so she can work on another? On the other hand, we could have benefited from having one more development resource. I ended up working at least triple the hours estimated by Taproot because I was doing extra duty as a web developer.  Also  It will be wise to talk to industry thought leaders about how to successfully plan and execute today's large-scale web projects. I suggest talking to interactive and software shops in particular; NOT ad agencies (ad agencies deliver Flashy marketing one-off sites, but not long-term web publishing platforms).  We had to flex the project management style and process a bit on this assignment in order to make it work for our huge scope. Over time, we came up with some efficient practices that might be beneficial for Taproot's blueprint. I've built several large-scale Drupal, Magento, and custom Wordpress sites, so I'll be happy to share some tips  So, if you'd like to discuss any of these points in more detail, reach out anytime."2130899734,32925279,12/10/2010,12/10/2010,12.186.229.38  ,jharvey22@gmail.com,,,,Jason,Harvey,jharvey22@gmail.com,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,The Unusual Suspects Board Recruitment Project,Board Recruitment,,Account Director,2,2,2,5,3,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,2,5,5,Working together for a common goal.

After our discovery phase, I structured our feedback in a way that helped them to hone in on their identity.  They were very thankful for the guidance, and I am glad that I was able to offer that. During that phase of the project, I was able to connect deeply with the organization and the mission, and found that very educational and rewarding.  ","Where do I start!  The Account Director was the most frustrating part of the entire project.  From the start, he was not engaged and hands-off the project.  I understand that it is a management philosophy, and that is fine if you empower your team to do their work and then stand back.  But, he did not.  From the start, he provided us incomplete information.  He did not seek out information and just sat there, not saying a single word, during the first three client meetings.  He provided no guidance - strategic, tactical, or organizational - during the entire project.  He did not keep us in the loop of his conversations with the client - never. We had weekly working sessions (of several hours each) for the first two months, and he never attended those nor followed up on progress.  He never got our questions answered.  He did not answer emails about coming to client meetings or our internal meetings, or addressed concerns when they were raised over email.    It all became unbearable when our initial designer quit a day before a major client meeting and milestone, and he told us to lie to the client - to tell the client that our designer is out sick, and that we would still deliver the promised designs within 4 days.  Right after the meeting, I wrote in an email that I do not lie to clients and I am not willing to be put in this kinds of situations.  Others followed.  He said that we were making a big deal out of nothing and left it at that.  When he found a new designer, she was not pulling her weight and not answering emails or committing to things.  This really made that phase of the process difficult and created a lot of frustrations for the entire team. We all voiced our frustrations over emails (we did not have any calls for several months, which is very usual in my experience).  He finally offered to speak to me over the phone (I don't know if he did the same with others), and I voiced my frustrations to him in an hour long call.  Then nothing happened.  Frustrations between the group members mounted (all over email).  We all ended the project not speaking to each other.  To add to the problems with the Account Director, our project manager lacked basic understanding and skills to manage the project.  During the first phase, where I was driving the discovery and strategy part, I drove the process and was very clear on what we had to do.  I organized the meetings, I drove the agenda and I included everyone in the decision making (although the Acct Director abstained from all of that).  But things really fell apart when my phase ended, and the website went into design and production - a phase where the project manager had to drive the process.  We did not hold weekly meetings.  There was no task follow up. Communication was just over email, where it is extremely easy to misinterpret things.  The new designer ""checked out"" of the project before she even checked in.  The copywriter was lost in terms of what her role was in the project (an issue raised many, many times by her and me and never addressed).  And I was frustrated because I could not do anything since there was an Acct Director and a project manager on the team.    Overall, this project was one of the most, if not the most, frustrating working experience I've had in my 13 years in the business.  It is really sad that I came in with a lot of enthusiasm to help the client, but left with full hate (and I don't use this word loosely) for this project.  Team management is crucial ",Sue Craft,"Steve Rokov, Rachel Murray, Ida Leung",Already have,,,"I already made these suggestions to others at Taproot to whom I spoke in the last few months.  I think project management training is key, especially for someone who is not a PM by title in their day job or it's their first Taproot assignment.  I think all first time volunteers could also benefit from some kind of training at the beginning of the project - to set expectations and to take people through a project, what to expect and how to deal with situations.  I think it would be good to divide it up by the title - all Acct Directors should be trained to be Acct Directors, all project managers, etc."2130899638,32925279,12/07/2010,12/07/2010,98.207.156.61  ,peggywrites@yahoo.com,,,,Peggy,Kenny,peggywrites@yahoo.com,,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,Girls for a Change,Advanced Website,,Copyeditor/Writer,4,5,5,5,3,4,4,2,4,3,1,4,5,5,2,For me the most rewarding aspect was working with the client.

There is another whole discussion to be had about website projects.

In the case of a creating or revamping a website, it would probably make sense to have 3 account people on the team.  However for a simple print brochure like the one for which I wrote the copy, the layers of protocol and procedure actually got in the way.  In addition, our Account Supervisor was virtually missing in action for about 70% of the project due to family issues.   To be fair to the team and project, I think she should have made Taproot aware of the lack of time she could devote to the project, so her responsibilities should have been reassigned to another Acct Sup, or even better, to the Account Executive.

In both cases, tough to recruit replacements once a project is up and running. Perhaps Taproot should consider having some ""reserve players"" for each wave of projects -- folks who volunteer to be available for just about anything in the event a team loses someone. A list which they maintain and provide to ADs looking for some help.

While this project suffered a few staff issues, the quality of both our core team and the client's made it manageable and (relatively) painless. Can imagine, however, that the line between success and disaster is a thin one -- based not just on quality of the work but team interaction and chemistry not to mention commitment to contribution -- and this applies to Taproot team as well as client's!   One small(er) thing to mention, probably more a personal perspective than anything else... As the AD who also (willingly) assumed the role of PM, I was very close to the process and because the team was open to my hands-on participation in the work product, I felt a strong sense of ""ownership"" of the work product. And thus very proud to be serving it up to the client. But can't imagine playing the AD role as arm's-length as might be suggested by Taproot's definition of the role. Have been warned that it's a good idea during the staffing process to indicate a tendency toward a higher level of participation so as to insure at least the PM is not offended, but that's a tough thing. Sorry, no immediate ideas on how to change this, necessarily, but perhaps should be strongly emphasized in the AD and PM training you do. Or perhaps ADs and PMs should be able to access each others profiles where comments like this could be served up about ourselves, etc.?  All in all, as mentioned, will do this again.

I was getting internal changes from one team member the night before the piece was due, putting them in stickies on the pdf and sending back to the art director at 1 am. I asked her to send me back the deck for proofing one more time, but she didn't, possibly due to the late hour, and we ended up giving the client a finished product with a typo in it. Fortunately, their board had further changes, which the art director and I did after the project closed, so we were able to fix the typo.  ","Robyn Futterman, Frank Wood","Bradley Graham, Jill Morrison",Already have,,"This was definitely a lot bumpier than my last Taproot experience. Under Jean Luc Lamirande on Girls' Inc., our team really geled. There was a clear understanding of the division of labor, and people were supportive of each other and respectful of each other's skills. This project was a bumpier ride. There were personality issues and professionalism issues (not showing up for the presentation when you are the person bringing the comp).","This was a stressful project for me personally because of events in my personal life. There was a bit of a culture clash between the people with advertising agency backgrounds and those coming from the client side, in terms of the process and the division of labor. I personally could have been more diplomatic about voicing my frustrations and have learned from this experience.  I think this project could have run more smoothly had the account director not weighed in on copy at the very last minute. A deadline for internal copy comments needs to be set and adhered to so mistakes don't get made.   I also think it might make more sense to schedule an additional presentation to the client between the first and last so they have something to take to their board. The board had a ton of changes after our project was officially closed,  and the art director and I completed the piece.  In some ways, I feel like meeting the schedule became more important than obtaining client buy-in. To be fair, this client did tend to drag their feet and had to be repeatedly prodded to respond. From my standpoint, better to finish a couple weeks later and have client approval on a finished piece than to meet the pre-planned deadline and have to work on the piece after Taproot's involvement has officially ended."2130899315,32925231,11/05/2010,11/05/2010,96.255.71.142  ,sharris@atirasgroup.com,,,,Sarita,Harris,sharris@atirasgroup.com,,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,Reston Interfaith Brand Strategy and Key Messages,Key Messages & Brand Strategy,,Project Manager,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,3,5,5,Presenting the results and recommendations to Reston Interfaith.,Some of the Taproot materials were difficult to understand and apply to the project.,We had a great team. ,,,Definitely would,,2130899314,32925231,10/28/2010,10/28/2010,68.34.22.116   ,shawnlwalters@aol.com,,,,Shawn,Walters,ShawnLWalters@aol.com,,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,Tahirih Justice Center,Annual Report,,Account Director,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,5,5,Learning about Tahirih's mission and getting to know the folks who work there,"we had a couple of staffing issues with the pro bono team -- a medical emergency meant we lost our writer, the replacement was not reliable.",most of the team,jesse hokeness,Already have,,,2130899313,32925231,10/16/2010,10/16/2010,96.24.125.25   ,cjj4885@yahoo.com,,,,Carla,Jones,cjj4885@yahoo.com,,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,Mujeses Latino In Accion,Human Resources Capacity Build,,HR Generalist,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,The client was genuinely greatful for everything that we brought to the table and where excited about the end result.,"The project seemed to start slow, and the initial conference calls seemed to be a waste of time.

I must acknowledge the commitment and effort put in by Karin Pavlovic: we would not have been able to keep the project on schedule without her dedication. She would be a great asset to any team, and I would be happy to work with any of them again. I would note that among the team, Crystal had the most frequent conflicts that affected her ability to contribute to the work product.  2) My client, Hour Children, had completed other Taproot service grants. It would have been useful to have access to the work product or team members that had worked on these past projects. This insight would have helped our team to have a more effective relationship with the client faster. I would suggest that for repeat clients, some sort of debriefing access be incorporated in the process, perhaps at the initial scoping phase of the project conducted by the AD. I would think that repeat clients would expect teams to have this knowledge and teams would benefit from the opportunity to leverage the institutional learning that is currently captive and unharnessed within Taproot.

It would indeed be a great disappointment to all of us on the team if it wasn't published, and if it won't be used for its intended purpose -- to help in the fundraising efforts of the hospital."2130899042,32925197,08/20/2010,08/20/2010,69.228.196.164 ,jonisf@gmail.com,,,,Joni,Sugimura,jonisf@gmail.com,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,Marin Agricultural Land Trust,Visual Identity & Brand Strategy,,Account Director,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,The Findings process is the most beneficial to everyone.

There needs to be some way to bring the writer into the discovery process early as she had to redo/revise many interviews with key informants so that we could produce the report.   I think if the project manager had been more assertive, then we could have kept to our goals better; certain it would have helped me realize I was taking too long with my portion of the project.  Likewise, a lack of rapport between the client and the project manager meant that they didn't keep to their deadlines either.

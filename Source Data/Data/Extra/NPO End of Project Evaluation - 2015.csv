We knew this was a problem and Taproot helped us address it and resolve it. It's important to us in terms of moving us forward.,"Our Taproot team was terrific. If there was an issue, it's one inherent in pro bono services: there were 5 people on the Taproot team (all volunteers) and 3 people on the Big Sunday team (two staffers spread very thin and a board member volunteer). It was not always easy to get everyone together, and some members of the team we wouldn't see for awhile. No one's fault, and the team was very accommodating about Big Sunday's schedule, too. Indeed, the Taproot folks were absolutely great about keeping us moving forward. I think the issue is a peril of pro bono work.",We have successfully used pro bono in the past.,,6 - 10%,,,,,,,,"We have found that often it is ultimately better for us to use paid services. Our lawyers are pro bono, but our legal needs are usually one-offs -- e.g., writing a contract, going over a lease. Sometimes when we've used pro bono services (e.g., web work) at a certain point we feel like we've overasked, are becoming a nuisance, or need to pick and choose how much we can ask for. Sometimes it can be a bit easier to raise the money. For instance, a number of years ago we wanted to do a strategic plan. In fact, Taproot did our Strategic Plan prep. Afterwards, we spoke to someone about doing the Strategic Plan pro bono. This was a nice and talented person at a large agency that does many strategic plans. He told us his company would do the plan -- and he WANTED to do the plan -- but he could never quite sign off on it, nor get his company to. In the meantime, we waited for over a year. (Finally, we raised the money and hired someone to do it.) Similarly, right now we're in the process of hiring a grant writer. I am speaking to 5 different grant writers/organizations. Some are clearly better matches for Big Sunday than others. This isn't a function of talent or skill, but personality, understanding, etc. This is an important enough job that I prefer to pay someone who I believe is the right match. Most likely, I wouldn't have the option of finding that match if I was doing this pro bono. We have worked with the same graphic designer/webmaster for years. Our process is that we bat many things back and forth until we get it to a place we like. If the reason we can't settle on something is indecisiveness or a change of plans on our part, we'll pay for his extra time. We work that into our budget. It's not a lot, but it allows us the freedom to take the time to get the work done the way we think works best for us. This is especially helpful with things like our website, which, because of the nature of our work, needs constant maintenance and updates. For the record: We think pro bono is great and have our own pro bono list (which includes things like yoga instruction and hairdressing). We also greatly appreciate all Taproot does for so many, and are grateful for, and indebted to, Taproot for the ways you've helped Big Sunday. Both of our experiences with Taproot and your teams have been terrific."

It was often his way and what he wanted, no discussion.      The Project Manager did a fine job but probably would've been better served to hold off on the project as she had a lot of personal things in the air.  It was a bit rocky in the beginning but did get much better towards the end, once things in her personal life settled down.    I would recommend that Taproot do a better job screening folks to take on the Account Director role as that's the most critical part - guiding volunteer professionals and moving towards project completion.  The Account Director should also have prior experience in the project that's being worked on. i.e. if it's a wordpress project you should have been a team member on a Wordpress project previously.  I can imagine it's hard to source team members as the commitment can be a bit large.  However, it's a critical role to team.  Having someone with zero Taproot experience, someone that didn't communicate, and someone that tended to undermine team members made this an incredibly frustrating, stressful, and negative experience.    The rest of the team was great and we did the best we could under the circumstances.  Some members even went way above and beyond considering the circumstances.

I thought that this is what was happening and I would focus on UX/UI design only. About a month later the other project manager told me they were still expecting me to develop the site.  - After it was clear we were way off the original timeline a new timeline was created. Again, I expressed concerns with the timeline and I was told by one the project managers that the timeline means nothing. I found this very frustrating.  - There was a large team. I felt it was very bloated and led to miscommunication and disorganization. No one except for myself knew the first thing about UX or UI design.  - I felt I was the only person who understood a typical web design/development process and felt the project would have run smoother if I ran it. I especially don't understand the need for two project managers.  - After many meetings, the project was put on hold. I heard nothing for about a year when I received a generic email saying your project is closed. I put a significant amount of time in this project that was completely wasted.

Fight for Children's fundraiser is extremely expensive - just one table costs $10k with a sponsor list of over 80 foundations, companies and business partners that give between 100k-25k each year. I don't see how they qualify as a non-profit that cannot afford a website? Most of that money they make at the fundraisers goes back into the Fight Night Fundraiser fund, so they can put on a bigger/badder fundraiser for the DC elite each year. After talking with sponsors, I know there is barely even a mention of the children the fundraiser benefits. Not only this, but FFC was pretty rude by the end of the project, demanding their website be done. I work a 50 hour week and then came home and did another 3 hours of work for FFC...

If I did not recruit a taproo developer from LA to help me create the actual wordpress framework website, I would have been a one man team. Our copywriter was great when she joined the project, but as time went on, her role dwindled, as the PM decided it was best for to just edit the copy and hten send it back to the client for them to change everything... So I 100% understand why she didn't want to spend too much time involving herself by the end.      My project manager was for the most part rude to me, and unhelpful. The project turned out well because I worked very hard and very well with the developer I recruited. But the amount of stress and headaches that were associated with this two year project leaves the worst taste in my mouth about Taproot.

We were caught 6 months after the reporting date so the client wanted to push out instead of ending with the prior year's data.  It seemed like the timeline expanded to suit the non-profit's timeline and I know this was very frustrating for some team members and made it difficult to maintain the enthusiasm/energy during the project.  Also, we should have had a team more closely located to the non-profit - having members from the OC and San Fernando valleys on a project meeting in the SGV resulted in many team members not joining the meetings and not wanting to meet ""face to face"".  In my prior grant with this non-profit, I recruited more locally and had much greater participation.  All that said, I felt we made an impact and I learned a lot (especially about the AR project piece)!",<br>3,I have had good experiences with Taproot and there is already a lot of project infrastructure created so it enables me to have a more strategic impact.

I makes it frustrating for an individual with experience to follow a person down the wrong path.  2) I certainly was consistently targeted treated in a disrespectful by one Team Member in particular who happened to be leading our team and no matter that they would not let up right up to the end. The project was very frustrating on that front however we all did what we needed to make  it work for the client.,Other (please specify),Consultant (initially Project Manager but changed 8/31),,,,,,,Somewhat disagree<br>2,Somewhat disagree<br>2,Somewhat agree<br>4,The Account Director and Project Manager were one and the same individual.,"Pei Chen - is outstanding, extremely organized, does her best and gives her best in whatever task she is delegated. Very helpful in many respects and also focused on moving the project forward. She was definitely a consistently calm, respectful and professional individual on the team and she was very instrumental in helping move the project forward by supporting the right suggestions at the right points. She is outstanding and a pleasure to work with, even when just the two of us the work was enjoyable and we built on each others contributions/expertise. We connected on Linkedin beyond the project.    Keith AuYeung - he is okay but has a tendency to do the minimal work and his heavy travel schedule (gone over half the project ) made it a bit hard. He did make a significant push at the end and during the external interviews but we felt the imbalance when he was on the road. However overall he was okay to work with, his availability might have made more of a difference. In terms of team he was mostly objective and definitely went with his convictions and was supportive of what appeared to be objectively the approach to take.","Ramona Chavez - I do appreciate her leading the team, however, in terms of contributions to the project content and approach really was quite minimal while being very hard on those who were making significant contriutions (Pei and I). Very combative personality and willing to do so regardless of whether there is a basis or not. Could work better at understanding priority of project pieces and moving them forward. I think this might have been her first experience doing such a project and I am sure the next go around she'll better understand how to fit the pieces together. Biggest feedback is to understand that by receiving others expert help one's leadership/control is not diminished. Our skills are meant to complement each other. It takes a mature leader to be confident even when they know nothing.",In my view I was pretty much influencing the project from the background as I appeared to be the only one who had done such work before from almost end to end perspective. I pretty much worked closely with Pei through most of the project and we had to be very tactful in planning how to help steer the project forward. She worked with me to help communicate some difficult suggestions so that Ramona would not either resist or reject them just because they were coming from me. I really tried to be helpful but I felt like I was perceived as a threat and things only got worse.  I was yelled at very early on in the project twice and asked not to be again however tension was continuous and there was a low level of objectivity in terms of just focusing on moving the project forward. I also think pursuing Board Membership made Ramona overly aggressive. It would have been helpful for the team to know that early on as perhaps that was the reason why she behaved as she did at times.  Knowing those underlying motives can help in management of  expectations of others and responding appropriately. The day I found out she was Board Member it seemed to just click and all of a sudden made sense why there had so much confusion. In hindsight the team could have worked more in person in the initial stages and probably built a better rapport/trust for one another.,<br>3,<br>3,<br>4,<br>4,<br>4,<br>3,<br>3,<br>4,Extremely likely<br>5,,Extremely likely<br>5,I have done pro-bono for over 10 years and love to serve in the community.
